# In the Thoughbot article it has custom method
# `loaded_files_excluding_current_rake_file` which is called in a `before`
# block. The purpose of this is to handle situations where you have more than
# one test of a rake file, which due to rake's idiosyncrasies can cause
# problems.
#
# However its inclusion leads to an issue where if a rake file contains more
# than one task and we have have a test for each, the last to be run will
# overwrite the results of the first in simplecov.
#
# So we have dropped its use and incorporated the notes from the stackoverflow
# article to cater for this situation, and ensure our test coverage is accurate.
